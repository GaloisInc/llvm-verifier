This directory contains a very simple script to build all of the central
sources from dietlibc that will easily build and package them up into a
single bitcode file. No attempt has been made so far to intelligently
select which functions to include; we just include everything that
builds without trouble.

The version of dietlibc this was tested with can be found here:

    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/dietlibc/dietlibc-0.32.tar.bz2

Note that dietlibc is licensed under the GPL.
