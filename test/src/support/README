- Bitcode files that the test harness executes are checked into .../support.
- For the time being, individual tests that are not hooked into the test
  harness yet (e.g., by-hand tests generated from C) live in
  .../support/ctests, and the Makefile in that directory can be used to
  produce transient bitcode files that can safely be removed.
