This repository contains the code for the LLVM Symbolic Simulator
(LSS). It is currently used primarily as a library from SAWScript, but
also produces a stand-alone executable, `lss`.

For information on using `lss`, see the tutorial in
[doc/lss-tutorial](https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-verifier/raw/master/doc/lss-tutorial/).
