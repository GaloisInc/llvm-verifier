_*NOTE 2020 Jul 17*_:  The functionality provided in this repository has been deprecated and is replaced by the `crucible-llvm` package in the https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible repository.  Users of this repository are urged to migrate to the newer replacement as support of this repository will likely cease in the near future.

This repository contains the code for the LLVM Symbolic Simulator
(LSS). It is currently used primarily as a library from SAWScript, but
also produces a stand-alone executable, `lss`.

For information on using `lss`, see the tutorial in
[doc/lss-tutorial](https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-verifier/raw/master/doc/lss-tutorial/).
